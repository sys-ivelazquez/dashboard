# Random Walk Simulator

This project implements a Dash-based web application that simulates different types of random walks: Brownian Motion (BM), Correlated Random Walk (CRW), and Lévy Flight (LF). The application allows users to visualize the generated trajectories in a 3D plot and analyze different metrics such as Path Length (PL), Mean Squared Displacement (MSD), and Turning Angle Distribution (TAD).

## Features

- Trajectory Types:

    - Brownian Motion (BM)
    
    - Correlated Random Walk (CRW)
    
    - Lévy Flight (LF)

- Metrics Computed:

    - Path Length (PL)
    
    - Mean Squared Displacement (MSD)
    
    - Turning Angle Distribution (TAD)

- Interactive Dashboard:

    - Radio buttons to select the trajectory type
    
    - Input fields to adjust parameters dynamically
    
    - Dropdown menu to select the metric to display
    
    - 3D visualization of the selected random walk
    
    - Graphical representation of the chosen metric
